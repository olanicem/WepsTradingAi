# WEPS Trading AI

WEPS (Wave, Epigenetics, Policy, Spiral) Trading AI is a **biologically-inspired financial AI system** that models the market as a living organism. It uses spiral intelligence, neural-like modules, and reinforced learning to orchestrate live trading decisions.

## Features

- **Neurons:** 20+ neuron modules analyzing market signals.
- **Spiral Phase Detection:** Detects and reacts to market phase transitions.
- **DNA & Genome Modeling:** Captures asset-specific behavioral patterns.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Adaptive policy engine for optimal decision making.
- **Live Orchestrator:** Executes trades in MT5, OANDA, and other brokers.
- **Logging & Memory:** Maintains spiral memory and reflex logs for full traceability.
